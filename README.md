# Recycle-Classifier
## Introduction
One day I found myself holding items in my hand unsure whether or not they should be thrown into the trash or the recycling. I couldn't recall my elementary school days when we learned about the phrase "Reuse, Reduce, and Recycle." Why not make it easier to know what can be recycled, thrown away, put into compost, or taken to a hazardous drop-off? This project is aimed at just that. The goal is to classify items as accurately as possible because if items are misclassified it can cause issues in the recycling pipeline.
