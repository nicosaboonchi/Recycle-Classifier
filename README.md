# Recycle-Classifier
## Introduction
One day I found myself holding items in my hand unsure whether or not it should be thrown into the trash or into the recycling. I couldn't recall my elementary school days where we learning about the phrase "Reuse, Reduce, and Recycle." Why not make it easier to know what can be recyled, thrown away, put into a compost, or taken to a hazardous drop off? This project is aimed to just that with as much accuracy as possilbe because if items are misclassified it can cause issues in the recycling pipeline.
